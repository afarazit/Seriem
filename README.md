Seriem is a simple application which lets you watch TV shows instantly.
[Install Latest Version](https://github.com/codirx/Seriem/releases/download/1.0.0/Seriem.msi) - 
I haven't uploaded all series yet. You can join the Seriem's discord from the help button in the Seriem to see the installed series.
# How Does It Work ?
It uses [Peerflix](https://github.com/mafintosh/peerflix) as a torrent engine.
